# Spotify Track Explorer

Full-stack portfolio project demonstrating **Spring Boot (Java)** backend + **Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind, daisyUI)** frontend.  
The app allows users to sign in, link their Spotify account, and explore playlists & tracks.  
Built to showcase clean OOP design, API integration, and AWS deployment skills.

## ðŸš€ Tech Highlights - (some of these features are coming soon!)

- **Spring Boot (Java 17)** â€“ REST API with JWT auth, Spotify account linking, and PostgreSQL persistence.
- **Next.js 15 + Tailwind/DaisyUI** â€“ modern UI with client/server components, dark mode, and responsive design.
- **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE** â€“ secure Spotify linking flow, tokens stored/auto-refreshed server-side.
- **PostgreSQL + Flyway** â€“ relational schema with versioned migrations for users, linked Spotify accounts, playlists, and tracks.
- **Testing & CI** â€“ unit tests for services, slice tests for API, GitHub Actions pipeline for build + test.
- **AWS-ready** â€“ designed for Elastic Beanstalk + RDS + Secrets Manager, with CloudWatch monitoring. Can run Next.js on Vercel for cost efficiency.
- **Cost awareness** â€“ architecture runs comfortably in free/low-tier AWS and Vercel, with Budgets/alerts for guardrails.
